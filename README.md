# Hospital-stay-pred


Predict the length of stay (in days) of a patient entering the hospital and given various factors of their stay in the dataset. Developed a predictive model to estimate the length of stay of a patient in the hospital using machine learning algorithms such as XGBOOST, KNN, MLP, and Support Vector with an accuracy score of 74%. Conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling. The insights obtained from the project could aid in resource allocation and patient management.
